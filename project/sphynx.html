The Sphynx project is an investigation of instruction cache design
with respect to the growing number of parallel single program
applications in the world.
When a single application is executed by a number of independent
threads, the instruction cache can be reasonably shared.
In this project, we examine the performance characteristics of a
variety of such applications and vary the cache configuration to see
which design is optimal.
