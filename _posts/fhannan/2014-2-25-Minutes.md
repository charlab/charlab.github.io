Here are the minutes from 2/25/14.

In Attendance: Prof Spjut, Donghyeon, Fabiha, and Akhil
Start time: 12:05 pm
End time: 1:01 pm

Updates:

- Akhil finished running the instruction counter for all of the benchmarks. This blog post has been updated with the numbers.

- I finished writing a parser to extract information and calculate the stalls due to the instruction cache. I couldn't work on the instruction duplication because we have not yet edited and looked at the banks.

- Donghyeon edited the instruction cache output to display the stats for each core's performance and made a more thorough list of each benchmark and its characteristics. These are in these two blog posts respectively: Instruction Cache Output and Sphynx Benchmarks.


Things to do this week:

1.	Make a table of GPU architectures & specs (Akhil)

2.	Work on the parser (Fabiha)

3.	See if =decreasing cache size makes a difference (same block size, reduce blocks to 1 set for 4-way set associativity (or from 1024 bytes to 512 bytes)) in the misses (Donghyeon)

4.	Independent assignment for everyone:

a) Come up with designs for shared cache [note: instruction memory tends to have sequential pattern & temporal repetition (loop)]

b) Skim a micro paper from last year and get a feel of what it should look like (Micro 2013 paper microarch.org)


Other notes:

- The default for instruction caches: instruction copied to each core and must merge 2 cores (aka put execution units together) to get it to share

- We are submitting to the IEEE microarchitecture conference: middle to end of May, we need it done at the beginning of May to submit to peer review
