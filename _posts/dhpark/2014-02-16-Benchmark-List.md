This blog post will keep a table of all the benchmarks & machine configurations that have been simulated and saved on Charlab machine. Update this table once the benchmark is run & the appropriate output files are moved into the results directory.

The output file of the benchmark will be saved in `/data/charlab/gpgpu-sim/RESULTS/' directory.
