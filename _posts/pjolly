Hi Everyone,

My name is Paul Jolly, and I'm a sophomore Engineering major. Funny story: I actually declared Engineering, but the registrar messed up and declared my '2nd Concentration' as Engineering. So my 'major' still reads undeclared and I still have a first-year advisor... haha...

Anyway, my interest in Digital Electronics really sparked this semester with E85. So far, I've enjoyed every bit from the 'tedious' labs to the tricky homework. It's actually material that I don't mind staying up for a long time doing. This being said, I'm interested in expanding my knowledge in the subject with this research group. While I'm open to and excited about learning as much as I can through the different projects, I'm particularly interested in working on the hardware side of things and kind of like Fabiha, not so much of a focus on abstract coding. This should be really exciting!

Thanks Eric, Dong-hyeon, and Fabiha for the extra tips in your posts.
