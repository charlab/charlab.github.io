The CPU cache stores copies of data from frequently used memory locations. This allows the run time of the CPU to be much
shorter since drawing/reading memory from the main memory locations requires more time. The cache memory is always a first
step for the CPU when writing or reading data. If the data being written/read is already present in the cache, it does 
not need to access main memory which saves time.

Three main types of caches:
- Instruction Cache: easy access to instruction data
- Data Cache: easy access to data
- Translation Lookaside Buffer (TLB): *** Not entirely sure what this meant

If the cache is full, the processor decides which cache entry to replace based on "Replacement Policies." A common 
replacement policy is least-recently used (LRU): data entry that is the least recently accessed is replaced.

Terms:
- Cache line: segments of fixed size in which data is transferred between memory and cache
- Cache hit: the processor finds something it needs in the cache
- Cache miss: needed data not present in cache; a new entry with needed data is consequently created (data needed is 
  copied from main memory into cache)
- Hit rate: number of cache hits divided by total number of accesses; used to measure cache performance
- CPU stalls: state when the CPU is waiting for a cache line to be fetched from memory (read latency). During this stall 
  time, the CPU could potentially complete many other computations. So, stalling can slow down computer significantly.
- Multi-threading: using multiple threads to access cache; This can speed up CPU run time because another thread can use 
  the CPU core while the first thread waits for data from the main memory (avoiding stall).
- Cache Size: amount of main memory it can hold = Num. bytes in Data block*Num. of cache blocks (See "Cache Entry 
  Structure Below")

Cache Entry Structure (One cache block):

---
Tag:
Data Block:
Flag Bits:
---

Tag: part of the address location of data in main memory
Data Block: Actual data fetched from main memory
Flag Bits: one bit the indicates whether or not there is a valid entry in the cache block (whether cache block is used)
