I'm considering offering a course consisting of a series of embedded
systems projects chosen by students to fit a certain theme. I think it
would be useful to test out the concept with some students this
semester (Fall 2013) to give me a chance to debug the methodology
before the class is offered in the Spring.

The idea is to have 4 weeks to work on a project, with regular
presentations, design reviews, and critiques. The only requirements
for the project are that they use some digital controller and they
must accomplish something cool and intersting receiving input and
providing output to the user/viewer. If you have an idea for a project
that fits this description, then I'd love to hear about it.
