So the first submission of the paper for the spock project has almost
officially been rejected. The reviewers heavily lean towards rejection
in their scores and I can't say I blame them. I would have made quite
a few changes to the paper before sending the final version for
publication if it had been accepted. However, I believe this rejection
is an important experience for the (former) students involed in the
process. 

First, it is encouraging that the reviewer were very constructive in
their feedback. Almost universally they said the idea has novelty and
potentially has merit, though we haven't proven that merit with the
paper in its current form. I pretty much agree with this assessment
entirely. The next course of action will be to switch the paper from
just presenting an idea to including a case-study of applying our
novel cache performance analysis technique to a series of cache
designs and replacement policies. Eric Storm has agreed to head up
this renewed effort, which is good because he hasn't graduated and
moved on to other things just yet.
