I forked [GPGPU-Sim](http://www.gpgpu-sim.org/) today into the charlab
github account. This is in preparation for beginning to use GPGPU-Sim
for our own research and experiments. I believe we will be using
the most recent version, called  v3.x.

If you want to see the repository, check 
[the github repository](https://github.com/charlab/gpgpu-sim/tree/master/v3.x).
The readme there gives a brief description of the prerequisites and
how to get started with GPGPU-Sim.
