I've noticed a few common typos lately that cause a bit of
disoragnization for the pages on this site. I thought I'd point them
out in a quick post (in case anyone feels like reading it).

The first has to do with the syntax for blog tags. You should list
each tag inside square brackets "[", "]" and separate each tag by a
comma and a space, not just a space. If you use a space, it will create a tag that has
a space in it. For example, `[gpgpu sphynx]` will create a tag with
the text "gpgpu sphynx" while `[gpgpu, sphyx]` will label the post with
two tags, "gpgpu" and "sphynx".

The other common typo has to do with the Sphynx project. It is spelled
with the 'y' before the 'n' rather than between the 'n' and 'x'. A few
times I've seen it spelled "sphnyx", which is incorrect and will not
show on the project page.
