I'd like to welcome a set of new student researchers to the Jetson
project. 
The list of people who are joining Charlab are as follows:

* Amy Ngai
* Da Eun Shim
* Ramy Elminyawi
* Andrew Fishberg
* Richard Piersall
* Kirklann Lau

The tentative assignments are for each person to be responsible for a
single lab assignment directly, while working with the rest of the
group on the bigger issues.

| Lab | Person  |
|-----|---------|
|  1  | Richard |
|  2  | Kirk    |
|  3  | Andrew  |
|  4  | Ramy    |
|  5  | Da Eun  |
|  6  | Amy     |

I'm excited to be working with all of you and hope we'll do wonderful
things this semester!
