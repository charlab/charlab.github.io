I'd like to welcome a couple new members to Charlab for the Spring 2015 semester.
The new members are *Jean Sung* and *Sebastian Krupa*. 
They will be working along with Andrew Fishbery on an entry for the
[Second Data Prefetching Championship](http://comparch-conf.gatech.edu/dpc2/).
I'm very excited to see the great work they accomplish this semester.
