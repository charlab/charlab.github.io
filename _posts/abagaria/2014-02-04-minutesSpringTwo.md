1. Eric spoke about his research in proposing a new data caching scheme. 

2. About 8 of the benchmarks work. We can make do with these. 

3. We have Cuda 5.5 and Cuda 4.0 as GPGPU Sim cannot use Cuda > 4.9.

4. Fahiba introduced Sami to the project and Sami has a python parser that they plan to use to parse
   the output files that were generated by the gp-gpu simulations. 
   
5. Fahiba raised an interesting point about only generating part of the output file so that we don't have to parse the
   ENTIRE output file. 

6. Look at Prof Spjut's blog post on 'screen' which allows multiple sessions on charlab to protect against connection
   loss etc.

7. We want to change the hardware configurations on GPGPU sim - DH.

8. Sami is going to generate the output files himself and figuring out what to look for in the output file. 
   He will also look at some journal papers. 
   
9. DH and Akhil will look at the hardware config files.
