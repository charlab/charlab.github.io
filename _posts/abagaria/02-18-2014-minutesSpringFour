1. We want to count the number of PTX instructions and not the # of sass instructions. This is because GPGPU sim is
   running PTX instructions. 
   
2. The instruction cache seems much larger than the size of the instructions in the seen benchmarks. Thus changing the 
   cache will not change the cache stats as the entire program is resident in the cache. 
   
3. We need to be able to make our own config. The current config is for GTX 480 which is outdated. We should probs 
   write a config file for the 680, 780s.

4. Fahiba and Akhil said that they can get the #instructions for all the benchmarks by Friday.

5. Samy said that given nothing changed from yesterday, he should be able to run programs on his machine. 

6. DH said that he separated the cache stats for the different 

7. NVIDIA's Cuda Core is an ALU/pipeline. GPGPUs core is a SIMD/SIMT core which has multiple cores in it. CUDA core is 
   also similar to an ALU. 
   
8. We could create a seperate top-level directory for all the scripts. We could also do version control using GIT.

NEXT WEEK
----------

1. Akhil: #Instructions per benchmark
2. Fabiha: Parser
3. Samy: Understand what the benchmarks do. Where it comes from, why its interesting. 
4. DH: Look up GTX 680, 780 and config files for the same.
