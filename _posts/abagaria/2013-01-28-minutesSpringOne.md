1. We have a machine on which user accounts need to be made. Email prof spjut preferred username.
2. Machine can run CUDA, so GPGPU is good. Need a way to parse output from GP-GPU sim. 
3. Sphyinx is not going to be using Tera anymore, but will use charlab.eng.hmc.edu
4. Running example code on new machine. 
5. Need to write python scripts to parse output. 
6. Need to think about the benchmark programs again as none of them ran on Tera.
7.
