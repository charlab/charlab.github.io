Spring 2014 Meeting One
------------------------

1. We have a machine on which user accounts need to be made. Email prof spjut preferred username.
2. Machine can run CUDA, so GPGPU is good. Need a way to parse output from GP-GPU sim. 
3. Sphyinx is not going to be using Tera anymore, but will use charlab.eng.hmc.edu
4. Running example code on new machine. 
5. Need to write python scripts to parse output. 
6. Need to think about the benchmark programs again as none of them ran on Tera.
7. Someone needs to go through the output and figure out what we need from there.
8. Just look at output file generated from last semester and think about the things needed.

Tasks for this week:
---------------------
9. Fabiha and Samy will be making the python parser. 
10. DH and Akhil will set up GPGPU sim etc on the new machine
