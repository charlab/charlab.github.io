Hello, 

I am a sophomore and an engineer. 

I am really enjoying E-85. 

I would love to work on projects which involve a combination of harware and software engineering.
At this point, I would love to explore the different areas within computer engineering. I hope that this research 
experience gives me the opportunity to learn about computer architecture, firware or even chip design. 

Thank you, 
Akhil.
