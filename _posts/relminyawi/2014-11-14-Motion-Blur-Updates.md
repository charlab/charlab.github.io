Hey everyone! I just wanted to give a quick update on how things are going with the 
post processing work. I managed to run a motion blur on an image that I had saved to 
my desktop, shown below, and for next week, I want to get the same type of blur to work 
on an image that is saved in memory. That way, I can progress to blurring videos that are
stored in memory and finally the game, which will be stored in memory as well. The image I 
blurred was found on a motion blurring tutorial (for Photoshop) page. I just tried to get
my blurred image to look as similar to the original blurred image as possible.
